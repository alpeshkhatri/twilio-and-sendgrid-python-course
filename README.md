## What's this course about and how is it different?

Many courses will show you a quick how-to with Twilio. In this **free** course, we will build a complete, end-to-end Flask web application with modern Python tools. **You will learn exactly what is needed to truly integrate text/chat with Python**. We'll sketch out the workflow in Twilio Studio and then create a series of HTTP/ JSON APIs in Flask that perform key integration. 

We will add text-intiated ordering for a hypothetical bakery called "Cloud City Cake Company". Over at the Cloud City website, we'll have a quick way to kick off a chat conversation in WhatsApp, hook important stages of that conversation with our Flask APIs, send rich emails and generate PDFs in Python.

Our customers will receive an email invoice as well an unprompted text message when their cake is ready for pickup. At the same time, this integration will communicate with our bakers about what cakes have been ordered and they can indicate when the cakes are finished.


## What we'll build

Here is a visual summary of just some of what you'll build during this course:
